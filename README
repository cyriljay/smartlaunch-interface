Smarlaunch interface designed for SL 4.5+. It was built using ActionScript 3 and Flash CS5.5.

<b>Background</b>
The interface was designed by ignite network gaming lounge in Chicago. It was built to improve the implementation of the previous interface and upgrade to ActionScript 3. We hope this provides a good base to expand on.
